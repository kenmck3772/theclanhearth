                lore: `Clan MacKenzie, "the Children of the Bright Fire," rose from humble beginnings to become one of the most powerful Highland clans. Founded by Coinneach (Kenneth), son of Colin of the Aird in the 12th century, they controlled vast territories from their stronghold at Eilean Donan Castle. The clan's motto "Luceo Non Uro" reflects their philosophy of enlightened leadership rather than destructive conquest. Their rise to power came through strategic marriages, loyal service to the crown, and shrewd political maneuvering. The MacKenzies were instrumental in the Jacobite risings, with their war cry "Tulach Àrd!" (The High Hill) echoing across Highland battlefields. Their territory encompassed the mystical landscapes of Kintail, where ancient Gaelic traditions flourished under their protection.`,

                lore: `Charles Edward Stuart (1720–1788) landed in Scotland in 1745 with just seven men, yet within months commanded a Highland army that nearly restored the Stewart dynasty. His charisma and romantic idealism inspired clans to rally to his cause, leading to stunning victories like Prestonpans. Though Culloden ended his dreams, his romantic legacy endures. The story of his escape through the Highlands, aided by loyal supporters like Flora MacDonald, became the stuff of legend.`,

                lore: `Coinneach Odhar (c. 1600–1660s), the Brahan Seer, was the Highlands' most famous prophet. His predictions, made through a blue stone, came true with startling accuracy centuries later. He foresaw railways, oil rigs in the North Sea, and the decline of Highland culture. His prophecies about the end of Clan MacKenzie power led to his execution by being rolled down a hill in a barrel of burning tar. His final prophecy about the last of the MacKenzies is yet to be fulfilled.`,
