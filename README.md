# The Clan Hearth — Static Site

This package sets the Clan Hearth badge as the logo and the castle image as the homepage background.

## Expected image files (place these in `/images/`)
- `clan-hearth-emblem.jpg` **(recommended logo)** or `clan-badge-2.png`
- `castlehome.jpg` **(hero background image)**

You already have these in your repo. If any are missing, the page will still load with fallback styles.

## Deploy
1. Upload these files to your repository root (keep existing `images/` if you already have the photos there).
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled for your repo (Settings → Pages).
3. Visit your Pages URL and hard refresh (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R).

## Notes
- This build keeps your structure: `/css`, `/js`, `/images`.
- If your castle image was saved as `castlehome..jpg`, rename it to `castlehome.jpg` for the background to appear.
