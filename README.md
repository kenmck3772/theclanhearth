# The Clan Hearth — Repopulated Build

- Badge is used as the logo.
- Castle is used as the hero background (with automatic fallbacks for `castlehome.jpg` or `castlehome..jpg`).
- Sections repopulated with sample data: Clans, Myths & Legends (11 items), and Recipes.
- Uses `/css`, `/js`, `/images` structure to match your repo.

## Image expectations
Put these in `/images/`:
- `clan-hearth-emblem.jpg` **or** `clan-badge-2.png` (logo)
- `castlehome.jpg` (hero). If your repo already has `castlehome..jpg`, keep it — the script will fall back to it.

## Deploy
Upload the files to your repo root. Keep your existing `/images` folder so the logo/hero show.
